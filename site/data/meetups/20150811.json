      "synopsis": "Justin has been wanting to make computer games since Space Invaders in 1982. That led him to teach himself game programming on the Apple II, then DOS, and eventually, years later, JavaScript. Retro pixel art and games are trendy again and he used the explosion of JS libraries and pixel-art nostalgia to remake some of the games of his youth -- and finally a new original game.",
